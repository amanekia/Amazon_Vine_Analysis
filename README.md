# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

In this project we were tasked with analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. 

## Analysis

We picked a dataset from the Amazon Review Datasets  link to dataset (https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Sports_v1_00.tsv.gz) and extracted the dataset into a data frame. 

## Results
Using the Dataframe we created we ran queries to answer the following questions:

1. How many Vine reviews and Non-vine reviews were there?

## Summary
From our data we can conclude that most of the reviews for the products are from non-vine customers.
